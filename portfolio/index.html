        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
After matric, I embarked on a journey to prove that success isn't solely dependent on formal education. I started as a cleaner at Tsebo Cleaning Services, then transitioned to being a waiter at Jacksons Restaurant at OR Tambo International Airport. My next venture was driving Shesha tuk-tuks, delivering passengers to their destinations. This opportunity introduced me to the gig economy, and I later became an Uber Eats delivery partner.

My career path took another turn when I joined Adapt Global as a general worker, where I focused on quality control for repaired mobile devices. Following that, I spent four years driving for Bolt.

I then worked as a waiter at Tiger's Milk Harvest in Kempton Park for two years, where I also gained valuable skills. During my tenure, I earned a certificate in IT Support from Hemmersbach and completed the ALX Professional Foundation program, which equipped me with essential skills in leadership, followership, and proficiency in tools like Google Workspace and Figma.

Currently, I'm an Operations Manager at The Maharaj, while continuing my studies in Front-End Development with ALX. My journey showcases my determination to learn, grow, and succeed despite unconventional beginnings..</p>
